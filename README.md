# A React Component - Progress Indicator
This repo contains a component for displaying a "Progress Indicator" with backdrop & spinner icon.
Use during async loading operations such as making a request or performing calculations.
Supports progress indication of parallel separate, but related, async events, this component will keep track of a count of active events.
 
## See Demo: []()
Source: [./src/App.js](./src/App.js)

## Usage 
```JSX
import ProgressIndicatorProvider, { ProgressIndicatorController } from "@jbacon47/react-component-progress-indicator"

function Example() {
  const handleSubmit = (loader) => (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    loader.signalLoading();
    // Replace timeout with app logic
    window.setTimeout(() => {
      loader.signalLoaded();
    }, 2000);
  }
  return (
    <ProgressIndicatorProvider>
        {/* .... */}
        <ProgressIndicatorController>
        {loader => (
            {/* .... */}
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(loader)}>
            <input type="submit" value="Try Me" />
            </form>
        )}
        </ProgressIndicatorController>
        {/* .... */}
    </ProgressIndicatorProvider>
  )
}
```
Exports:
- `ProcessIndicatorProvider` - Wraps content with spinner backdrop
- `withProgressIndicator` - Wraps child component with controls
- `useProgressIndicator` - Wraps child component with controls
- `ProgressIndicatorController` - The controller context
Features:
- Available Controls:
    - `context.signalLoading()` - increments number of active loading events (> zero, show spinner)
    - `context.signalLoaded()` - decrements number of active loading events (== zero, hide spinner)
- If making many parallel async/loading requests, the provider keeps track of the current count

# Development
I built this because I did not see any out-of-the-box solutions for progress indicators that support multi/parallel async events. Most spinners are simple and require managing properties and visibility state on a single component.

## Run Demo
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
